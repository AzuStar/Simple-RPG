# Simple-RPG

(Like really simple, but also not really, may be I dunno)
I will add more description to this repo and how to set up the project etc. For now I will put basic code here and create extension using pixijs, so my pupils can jump to creating assets and start setting up the game.
Complex machanics such as scrolling, precedurally generated levels I will implement myself, but all the code is always avaialable in this repo.
